Learning how to build backend for GoLang web applications

This is going to be a backend application fully managing a restaurant.

# It follows a NodeJS application structure, and is distributed in the patter

Welcome to the Go RM Backend repository! This repository showcases a robust and scalable backend implementation using the Go programming language. It serves as a powerful resource management system that efficiently handles various operations and provides a seamless experience for managing resources.

## Key Features

- **Resource Management**: The backend is designed to handle resource management efficiently. It supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing resources, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

- **RESTful API**: The backend exposes a RESTful API, allowing seamless integration with various clients and systems. It follows industry best practices and conventions, providing a standardized approach to resource management.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: The backend includes robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to resources. It supports user registration, login, and role-based access control, providing granular control over resource management.

- **Database Integration**: The backend seamlessly integrates with a database system, providing persistent storage for resources. It utilizes the Go database/sql package to establish connections, execute queries, and handle database operations efficiently.

- **Scalability and Performance**: The backend is designed with scalability and performance in mind. It leverages the power of Go's concurrency model to handle concurrent requests and efficiently utilize system resources, ensuring optimal performance even under high loads.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with the backend, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Go programming language (version 1.16+): [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)

- Database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite): Choose and install a suitable database system based on your requirements.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the Go RM Backend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Coffeedragon96/go-rm-backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd go-rm-backend
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

4. Configure the database connection:

   - Open the `config.yaml` file and provide the necessary details for connecting to your chosen database system. Update the `database` section with the appropriate values for your database host, port, credentials, and database name.

5. Build and run the backend:

   ```bash
   go build
   ./go-rm-backend
   ```

   The backend will start running on the specified port (default is port 8080) and establish a connection with the configured database.
